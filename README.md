# Huawei Modem IP Reset Script
A script that automatically disables &amp; enables the mobile data to reset IP on Huawei modem. It is tested with **WEBUI 11.0.1.1** on **Huawei B535-232**. It should work on other devices with same Web UI version. But I'm not able to say anything because I didn't test it with other devices.

## How to install?
1. Install required NPM packages with following commands: `npm install axios` `npm install crypto-js`
2. Edit app.js file and enter your admin username & password.
3. Run the app with following command: `node app.js`
